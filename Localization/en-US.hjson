					Tooltip:
						'''
						A preset for the settings below may be chosen
						With very high or ultra, do not set waves quality to off except in camera mode
						Lower presets have better performance but lower quality
						'''
				}

				# Smooth Lighting
				
				UseSmoothLighting: {
					Label: Enable Smooth Lighting
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use smooth lighting
						If disabled, vanilla lighting visuals are used
						Rendering performance is affected primarily by the GPU
						Requires lighting to be set to color
						'''
				}

				UseLightMapBlurring: {
					Label: Blur Light Map
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to blur the light map
						Applies a per-tile blur to the light map before rendering

				}

				UseLightMapToneMapping: {
					Label: Use Light Map Tone Mapping
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use a tone mapper on the light map

						May slightly reduce performance when enabled
						'''
				}

				LightMapRenderMode: {
					Label: Light Map Render Mode
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls how the light map is rendered
						Affects the smoothness of lighting
						Bicubic upscaling is smoother than bilinear upscaling
						Overbright rendering increases the maximum brightness of light
						With overbright rendering, do not set waves quality to off except in camera mode
						Settings farther to the right may reduce performance
						'''
				}

				NormalMapsStrength: {
					Label: Simulated Normal Maps Strength
					Tooltip:

						Set to 0 to disable
						May reduce performance when enabled
						'''
				}

					Label: Simulate Fine Normal Maps
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles between coarse and fine simulated normal maps
						Coarse normal maps have 2x2 resolution, and fine 1x1
						Recommended to enable when using HD textures
						'''
				}

				RenderOnlyLight: {
					Label: (Debug) Render Only Light
					Tooltip: When enabled, tile, wall, and background textures are not rendered
				}

				# Ambient Occlusion
				
				UseAmbientOcclusion: {
					Label: Enable Ambient Occlusion
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use ambient occlusion
						If enabled, tiles produce shadows in front of walls
						Rendering performance is affected primarily by the GPU
						Requires lighting to be set to color
						'''
				}

				DoNonSolidAmbientOcclusion: {
					Label: Enable Ambient Occlusion from Non-Solid Tiles
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether non-solid blocks generate ambient occlusion
						Non-solid tiles generate weaker ambient occlusion
						Primarily affects furniture and torches
						Not all non-solid tiles are affected
						May reduce performance when enabled
						'''
				}

				DoTileEntityAmbientOcclusion: {
					Label: Enable Ambient Occlusion from Tile Entities
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether tile entities generate ambient occlusion
						Tile entities generate weaker ambient occlusion
						Primarily affects moving, non-solid tiles (e.g., tiles affected by wind)
						Reduces performance more than the setting directly above
						'''
				}

				AmbientOcclusionRadius: {
					Label: Ambient Occlusion Radius
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls the radius of blur used in ambient occlusion
						Higher values correspond to larger ambient occlusion shadows
						'''
				}

				AmbientOcclusionIntensity: {
					Label: Ambient Occlusion Strength
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls the strength of shadows in ambient occlusion
						Higher values correspond to darker, larger ambient occlusion shadows
						'''
				}

				AmbientLightProportion: {
					Label: Ambient Light Proportion (%)
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls the proportion of light considered to be ambient
						Ambient occlusion reduces only ambient light, not direct light
						Higher values correspond to darker ambient occlusion shadows
						'''
				}

				# Lighting Engine
				
				UseFancyLightingEngine: {
					Label: Enable Fancy Lighting Engine
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use a modified lighting engine
						When enabled, light is spread more accurately with noticeable shadows
						Performance is affected by the number of light sources in the scene
						Lighting performance is affected primarily by the CPU; the GPU is not used
						Requires lighting to be set to color
						'''
				}

				FancyLightingEngineUseTemporal: {
					Label: Use Temporal Optimization
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use temporal optimization with the fancy lighting engine
						When enabled, optimizes lighting using data from the previous lighting update
						Makes lighting quicker in more intensly lit areas
						May sometimes cause lighting quality to be slightly reduced
						'''
				}

				FancyLightingEngineMakeBrighter: {
					Label: Brighten Lighting
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to make lighting slightly brighter
						When disabled, lighting along the axes is slightly darker than with vanilla lighting
						May reduce performance when enabled
						'''
				}

				FancyLightingEngineLightLoss: {
					Label: Light Loss (%) Exiting Solid Blocks
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls how much light is lost exiting a solid block into the air
						Higher values correspond to darker shadows
						'''
				}

				FancyLightingEngineLightAbsorption: {
					Label: Light Absorption (% of vanilla) of Solid Blocks
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls how much light is absorbed inside solid blocks
						Lower values allow light to spread farther into solid blocks
						A value of 100% is equivalent to vanilla
						'''
				}

				FancyLightingEngineMode: {
					Label: Fancy Lighting Engine Resolution
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls the internal resolution of the fancy lighting engine
						Does not affect the final resolution of the light map
						Higher values increase the accuracy of shadows but reduce performance
						'''
				}

				SimulateGlobalIllumination: {
					Label: (Experimental) Approximate Global Illumination
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to simulate a basic form of global illumination
						When enabled, indirect lighting makes shadows brighter
						May cause a large reduction in performance when enabled
						'''
				}

				# Sky Color
				
				UseCustomSkyColors: {
					Label: Enable Fancy Sky Colors
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use modified sky colors
						If disabled, vanilla sky colors are used
						'''
				}

				CustomSkyPreset: {
					Label: Sky Color Profile
					Tooltip: Selects which set of sky colors is used
				}

				# General
				
				ThreadCount: {
					Label: Thread Count
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Controls how many threads smooth lighting and the fancy lighting engine use
						Higher values typically improve performance with diminishing returns
						Values greater than the number of CPU hardware threads may reduce performance
						The default value should be close to optimal
						'''
				}

				UseHiDefFeatures: {
					Label: Use Enhanced Shaders and Colors
					Tooltip:
						'''
						Toggles whether to use enhanced shaders and colors allowed by the FNA HiDef profile
						When enabled, some visual effects are improved:
						- Increases the precision of colors used in lighting
						- Increases the maximum overbright light brightness
						- Improves simulated normal maps
						- Performs gamma correction when paired with overbright rendering
						May significantly reduce rendering performance when enabled
