Fancy Lighting improves the quality of lighting by adding a new lighting engine and various shaders.

Features:
- Smooth lighting
- Ambient occlusion
- Accurate shadows
- Fancy sky colors
- HDR rendering (tone mapped to SDR)
- Bloom
- Simulated normal maps
- Camera mode compatibility

For the best performance, lower the in-game resolution to either 1920x1080 or 1920x1200 depending on the aspect ratio of your display.

Occasionally, after launching the game, this mod might not work. This can usually be fixed by restarting the game.

Some tiles are tinted when being drawn. For example, pearlstone is tinted pink so that its in-game appearance is more pink than its texture. Smooth lighting supports all vanilla tinted tiles. Modded tinted tiles are not supported.
