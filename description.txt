Fancy Lighting improves the quality of lighting by using a new lighting engine and various shaders.

Features:
- Smooth lighting
- Ambient occlusion
- Accurate shadows
- Fancy sky colors
- HDR rendering (tone mapped to SDR)
- Bloom
- Simulated normal maps
- Camera mode compatibility

For the best performance, lower the resolution to either 1920x1080 or 1920x1200 depending on the aspect ratio of your display. For example, running the game at 1920x1080 and 100% zoom results in better performance than 2560x1440 and 133% zoom. The frame rate can be checked by pressing F10.

Some tiles are tinted when being drawn. For example, pearlstone is tinted pink so that its in-game appearance is more pink than its texture. Smooth lighting supports all vanilla tinted tiles. Modded tinted tiles are not supported.
